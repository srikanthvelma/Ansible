Definations of Terms used in Cloud
-----------------------------------

1. **High Availability**  
*  High availability refers to the ability of a system to provide uninterrupted service to users, with minimal downtime. The goal of high availability is to maximize uptime, so that users have access to the system and its services at all times.
*  High availability is typically achieved through redundancy, load balancing, and other techniques that help ensure that critical components continue to function even in the event of a failure.

2. **latency**
* Latency is a measure of the time delay between a request being made and the corresponding response being received.
* In computing, latency refers to the time it takes for a data packet to travel from its source to its destination, including any processing time. 

3. **Fault Tolerence**
* Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue operating correctly even if one or more of its components fail
* The goal of fault tolerance is to minimize the impact of failures, so that users are not affected by them
* Fault tolerance is typically achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms, which ensure that the system continues to function even if one component fails.

4. **Business continunity and Disaster recovery**
*  business continuity focuses on maintaining an organization's core operations in the face of disruptions
*  disaster recovery focuses on restoring IT systems and data following a disaster.
