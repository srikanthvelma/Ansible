Definations of Terms used in Devops
------------------------------------

1. **Idempotence**
* Idempotence is a property in DevOps states that an operation can be repeated multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. 
* This property is important for DevOps processes such as software deployment and configuration management, where the same script or command should produce the same result regardless of how many times it's run. 
* This ensures that automated processes are predictable and repeatable, making them easier to maintain and debug.
  
2. **IAC**
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes

3. **static code analysis**
* Static code analysis is the process of analyzing source code to identify potential security vulnerabilities, bugs, performance issues, and coding standard violations without executing the code (debugging)
* It is performed by automated tools, which scan the code and report any problems or warnings that they find.
* The goal of static code analysis is to improve the quality and security of software systems by detecting and fixing issues before they become problems in production.
  
4. **Quality gate**
* Quality Gates are the set of conditions a project must meet before it should be pushed to further environments. 
* Quality Gates considers all of the quality metrics for a project and assigns a passed or failed designation for that project.
